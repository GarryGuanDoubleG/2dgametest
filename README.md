# Conquest-Rule-or-Die

A full game demo featuring a custom 2d engine written in C.
Library uses: http://www.libsdl.org/ SDL for graphics mode, image loading, audio and font rendering.

Conquest applies a strategic base-building survival rpg genre including procedurally generated game maps,
roaming AI enemies that use an A* search algorithm for pathing, resource managers, and base building rpg strategies to understand
different concepts of game development.

Your goal is to survive the post apocalyptic world by building a base to grow character until you are able to defeat the evil God
that cursed the world!
